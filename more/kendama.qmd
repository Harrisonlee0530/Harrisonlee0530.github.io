# Introduction
Kendama (けん玉 or 剣玉) is a traditional Japanese skill toy that has grown into an international sport, blending precision, creativity, and perseverance. At its core, the game involves catching a wooden ball (tama, 玉) on different parts of a spiked handle (ken, 剣), but the real challenge lies in mastering the countless tricks, combinations, and flows that players around the world continue to invent.

What makes Kendama special is the balance it strikes between skill, patience, and training. Every trick requires focus and control, and progress comes only through repeated practice and determination. The process is humbling — drops and misses are part of the journey — but with persistence, even the most difficult tricks become achievable.

Beyond being a toy, Kendama is a discipline that cultivates concentration, resilience, and creativity. It is a community-driven sport where players of all levels can connect, share, and push one another to grow.

I began practicing Kendama in December 2022, and over time I came to see it as more than just a skill toy. The deliberate repetition of movements, the quiet focus on balance, and the acceptance of failure as part of progress all resonated with me as a kind of meditation. Each missed catch is a reminder of patience, and each successful landing reflects persistence rewarded. In this way, Kendama has become not only a physical practice but also a philosophy of life, one that mirrors the mindset I bring to both academic and personal challenges.
