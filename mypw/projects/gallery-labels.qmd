Gallery Labels is a Shiny for Python application designed for an artist for creating, managing, and exporting exhibition labels formatted for print (fractional A4 size cards).

The application allows manual entry or bulk upload of artwork metadata and supports export to print-ready PDF (double-spaced, embedded font)

The main goal for this application is to get used to github workflow and Shiny for Python

## Features

- Create labels via sidebar form inputs
- Bulk upload labels from CSV
- Delete labels using a title-based dropdown selector
- Session-isolated user data (no shared state between users)
- Export labels as:
  - PDF (print-ready, double-spaced typography)
